# Movies-ETL Analysis

Module 8 Challenge
## Overview of Project
###Purpose
In preparation for a hackathon, Britta was looking to gather data from both Wikipedia and Kaggle, combine them and create an SQL database for the hackathon participants to use. To do this, Britta has asked us to use the ETL process (extract, transform and load) to create a clean dataset in a SQL database. 

### Summary + Results
Throughout the ETL process, much redundancy was revealed and missing data between Wikipedia and Kaggle, but not limited to the following: 
* Incomplete and differing titles between Wikipedia and Kaggle
* Formatting for dates were inconsistent 
* Formatting for budget numbers were inconsistent 
* Many columns needed to be merged, such as Director/Directed by, run time/running time, etc., due to the redunancy 

With the final data cleansing and parsing, we were able to create a clean dataset for the hackathon participants to use.
